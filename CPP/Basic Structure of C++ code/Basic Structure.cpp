// C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of C.
// It combines the power of C (procedural) with features like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

#include <iostream>     // Header for input-output operations
using namespace std;    // To use standard names without std::

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, World!" << endl; // Output
    return 0;                        // Program ends
}
